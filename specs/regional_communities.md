# Spec-<Number>: <Title>

## Summary

Background and short summary in layman terms.

## Context

What's the "historical" context? Why do we need a new project?
Identify the problems and the needs.

## Scope and Requirements

Describe:

- Expected functionality.
- Potential security issues and requirements.
- User profile description. Who is the user? How she/he is expected to us it?
- Requirements, assumptions and dependencies (internal and external).
- Outline identified potential problems and roadblocks related to building the solution.
- Optionally: Budget limit.

### Backwards Compatibility

All proposals that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The doc must explain how to deal with these incompatibilities or the set of requirements to for the backward compatibility to be discussed in a submission. Submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Use Cases

### Actors

List all users and their types

### Actions

List the actions each collective will take individually.

Describe which action is done by which actors. Feel free to use a table format or provide your own graphics or bundle the description in the Actions section. A "swimlane process chart" often works well here.

|         | Action 1 | Action 2 | Action 3 | action 4 |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Actor 1 |          |          |          |          |
| Actor 2 |          |          |          |          |
| Actor 3 |          |          |          |          |
| Actor 4 |          |          |          |          |
