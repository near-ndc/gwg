# üèó  KUDOS widget for NDC - Meta Pool Submission

# RFP-2 Meta Pool

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Introduction & Motivation

A reputation system is mechanism designed to assess and quantify the trustworthiness, reliability, or quality of entities, such as users or services within a given network or community.
Reputation is a need in the context of Near Social. Kudos can be used to build reputation by issuing SBT.

One of the challenges for a reputation system is to be sybil resistance, that is a to be resistance to sybil attacks, which involves an user forging multiple identities to manipulate reputation scores, for example.
By incorporating proof-of-personhood mechanism (i-am-human) in multiple stages we can prevent fraudulent activities and keep the protocol secure.

Another challenge to face for the reputation system is to be spam free. Using proof of personhood is not enough to protect a system from abuse.
There are many alternatives to adress that, we propose the following.

* Limit that activity: Any human can send maximum 14 kudos per week. The quota will reset every Sunday at midday UTC (12:00). The quota will be a parameter and the admin will be able to change it in the future.
* The target user should be in control of the Kudos they recieve. Unwanted Kudos can be removed from display by either the nominee or nominator.
* The target user should also be able to set their preference to either auto-accept incoming Kudos to their profile, or require a manual review & approval before accepting incoming Kudos
* The target user should be able to set their preferences to accept incoming Kudos from endorsed users, that is users that already have a specific endorsed sub-category, eg: Developer, Community Builder, Product Lead, Marketer, Project Mgr, Sales, Researcher, Architect, Data Scientist, Creative ... 

## üèó Proposed Solution

Implement an app that will manage diffent kinds of Kudo categories:

1. "Standard Kudo" for general social awarding. Sub-categories include: Thank You! Good Job! Impressive! Excepional!...
2. "Endorse Kudo" for attestation on specific skills. Sub-categories include: Developer, Community Builder, Product Lead, Marketer, Project Mgr, Sales, Researcher, Architect, Data Scientist, Creative ...  
3. "Nominate Kudo" for nominating your self of backing someone else in their candidacy for some sub category. Sub-categories include: House of Merit, Transparency Commissson, Counsil of Advisors, Creatives DAO, Marketing DAO

App will provide views/pages for 3 differents roles:

* Visitors
* Users
* Admin
