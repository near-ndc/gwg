**Introduction**

I am a seasoned javascript developer , skilled in JavaScript, ReactJS, CSS, and NEARJS API, with a profound understanding of blockchain and smart contracts. I have been involved in a number of successful projects including the development of the I am Human web app.

**Proposed Solution**

My proposed solution involves the development and implementation of the Kudos Widget, a user interface component designed for seamless integration with the i-am-human smart contract. My service will include the design, development, and testing of the widget.

**Implementation Plan**

The widget will provide the following functionalities:

1. **User Verification:** The widget will call the i-am-human smart contract for user authentication. Upon user interaction with the widget, it will initiate the smart contract execution to verify that the user is human.

2. **Sending Kudos:** Once the user is verified as human, they will have the option to send 'kudos'. The widget will interact with the kudos smart contract to execute this transaction.

3. **Receiving Kudos:** Any verified user can receive 'kudos', with the received kudos displayed in the user's account and a notification sent via the widget.

4. **Displaying Kudos:** The widget will maintain a count of the total 'kudos' each user has received and display it on their profile.

**List Dependencies You Plan to Introduce**

The primary dependencies are the i-am-human and kudos smart contracts. The widget also relies on JavaScript, ReactJS, CSS, and NEARJS API for its functioning.

**How Do You Plan to Test the Solution**

The widget will be thoroughly tested at each development stage using a combination of unit testing, functional testing, and end-to-end testing. User testing will also be performed to ensure the user interface is intuitive and easy to use.

**Ongoing Support / Maintenance Proposal**

I am committed to providing ongoing support and maintenance for the Kudos Widget. This includes troubleshooting and resolving any issues, making improvements based on user feedback, and ensuring the widget is always up to date with the latest technology standards and user needs.

**Contractual Considerations**

I propose a contract with clear timelines and deliverables. Any changes or modifications to the agreed-upon services will require mutual consent.

**Backwards Compatibility**

The implementation of the Kudos Widget is designed with backward compatibility in mind. The widget's reliance on the i-am-human and kudos smart contracts means that any changes to these contracts could affect the widget's functionality. However, we will ensure that any updates maintain compatibility with previous versions or provide sufficient documentation and support to handle any incompatibilities.
