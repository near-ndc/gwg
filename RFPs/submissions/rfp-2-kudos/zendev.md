# RFP-2: Kudos Widget for NDC

## Summary
Constructed on the foundation of BOS and utilizing SocialDB, the application will integrate the i-am-human verification system. This integration ensures that, regardless of the number of wallets a user creates, their account will be governed by the i-am-human contract.

The Kudos widget, as a key component of this application, will empower every verified human user to nominate, receive, and engage with Kudos on Near Social. This enables a streamlined, secure, and human-centric interaction model within the platform.

## Context 
On the blockchain-based social platform, Near Social, users need a way to recognize, appreciate, and validate each other's contributions in a consistent, tamper-proof, and meaningful way. The challenge lies in the lack of an integrated, on-chain mechanism to manage and verify such reputation indicators.

Furthermore, spamming is a significant issue in digital reputation management, which, if not addressed adequately, can degrade the quality of interactions and user experience. Users need the ability to control who can acknowledge their contributions and comment on them to maintain a positive and spam-free environment.


## Proposal 

App will have dynamic fields and protected routes based on Users role
We will have 4 roles
 - Visitor 
 - User
 - Humans
 - Admin ( I will need some clarifications for this role) 


App will be created on BOS using SocialDB.
This app will contain 
- Homepage (
  -- Dynamic Header
  -- About Kudos ( What & Why )
  -- List of latest kudos (aprox 20/30 per page)
  --Kudos filters ( kudos can be filtered by tag or user )
)
-- Single Kudos page 
-- Create New Kudos 
-- Profile Page   
-- Admin Profile Page/Settins

## Expected Timeline

I will split this kudos task in 2 versions. 
First version will have basic functionalities. 
Second version will have extra functionalities, such as notifications, admin page improvement, animations, expiration time. 

### Version 1
1. Design ( Mobile/Tablet/Desktop) UI & UX

10. Delete Kudos - we need to define who can delete kudos and how
11. Include SBT - Need more info about it 


**Diagram with users flow & app permisions can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMGLmjJ4=/)**

Aprox time for desigh: 2 weeks - 400-500 NEAR 
Aprox time for development (for things which we know): 14 weeks -> 2 devs ( 7-8 weeks each ) -  3000 NEAR 

Price and time frame are not fixed, after clarifications we can talk more about it. But this is like initial offer

**Please be aware that it is not our full-time commitment. We will be dedicating approximately 15-20 hours per week to the development and implementation of the Kudos widget. Consequently, some phases of the project may require a slightly extended timeframe to ensure that the work is of the highest quality and meets all specifications and requirements**


### V2 
Plans for version 2 are 
1. Notifications ( we can use pagoda console to get info when someone create kudo and inform receiver )
2. Gamification, for each received kudos/upwotes/reaction you can get points.
3. Send account SBT Badge for each Kudo
4. expiration time of kudos -> I think that we will need backend here for cron job, so question is who will host backend, can we do this in decentralized way, etc. 
5. Administration features ( not sure what will admin has )
6. Transitions & animations ( depeands of keyframes on BOS, currently I find out that it doesn't work on BOS)


**We can move tasks from V2 to V1 or the opposite.**

# Team 

Currently my plan is to have 3 people on this gig. 
1. Senior designer who will design ( My colleague, working with me for 3 yrs )
2. Frontend Developer ( My colleague, working with me for 5 yrs now. we are well-coordinated and work great together  )
3. Myself ( Discord & Telegram: ZenDev, twitter: https://twitter.com/CryFamBrother )


## Open Questions and Comments

1) What is more preferred - to use SocialDB or create own smart contract ?
2) Difference between tags & categories
3) Explanation about admin role
4) Notifications. If we want to use Notifications API from web browser we will need backend. 
5) Expiraton -> For counting time we will need cron job, so again we will need some backend. Who is owner of it, but maybe there is solution on NEAR chain which I am not avare of.
6) Can we get some assistance from Near Social team? 
7) Can we use pagoda console? ( not sure why that will be problem but good to know at the beginning) 
8) How actually SBT will be connected with kudos, and where it will be minted. 


## Final Thoughts
I perceive this project as a unique opportunity to extend my expertise in BOS and SocialDB technologies. The Kudos widget, beyond being just a project, offers the potential to create something exceptional that will be directly used and appreciated by the user community on Near Social.

The implementation of this widget aligns with my professional objectives, allowing me to contribute significantly to the user experience and overall ecosystem. The realization that I am creating something that will enhance user interactions and recognition on the platform is highly motivating.

Furthermore, this project stands as a stepping-stone for my growth as a developer . The goal is not merely to deliver a successful project but also to contribute to the strengthening of our digital community.
