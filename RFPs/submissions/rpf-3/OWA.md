# RFP-3 OWA 

# Introduction
The Open Web Academy team is a highly experienced Web 3 developer on the NEAR Ecosystem. This team is going to create the solution required for the Kudos Widget:
1. Luis Mendez, BOS developer who has participated in the ETH Dubai hackathon, who has won the Sushi swap and Gains Network track with BOS.
2. Daniel Mora, smart contract developer experienced in Solidity and Rust for over 3 years.
3. Edward Vergel. Backend and Blockchain developer, Web3 security researcher with 3 years of experience in software development.

# Proposed Solution

## Project approach
We'll start developing modules in the following order to fulfill the request: 
### Authentication
This module will interact with the i-am-human smart contract  to verify the user identity.
### Kudos feed
This module will read all the kudos, showing in the main view.
### Kudos user
This module will read all the userâ€™s kudos as a profile.
Also the user will set up who can send him kudos or comment on them according to the category selected (all, friends, close friends, no one).
Allow recipients to accept or not the new kudos.
### Create a kudo
This module will let any authenticated user create a new kudo for any active user related to him. 
Requiring the creator user to have a  i-am-human-certified before they can send or comment on Kudos.

## Implementation plan
It is expected to complete the project in no more than four weeks, including all development phases.
The project is planned to be developed in 3 stages 
### Planning and Architecture Stage Week 1
Project planning and architecture design. 
### Development Stage 2 Week 1-3  
Frontend development and smart contract development 
### Integration and Testing Stage 3 Week 4

### Beta release
To receive early feedback from potential customers

## Ongoing support / maintenance proposal
### Defining maintenance scope
### Developing maintenance plan 
For saving the customers reviews and setting maintenance steps. 
### Continuous Improvement
