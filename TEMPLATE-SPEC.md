# Spec-<Number>: <Title>

## Summary

<!-- One page high-level overview; put details in the specification section and background in the previous section. Should be understandable by a new engineer or reader who isn't already working on the project. Short summary in layman terms. -->
<!-- List the challenge(s) being solved by this widget. What is the problem? -->
<!-- One page high-level overview; put details in the specification section and background in the previous section. Should be understandable by a new engineer or reader who isn't already working on the project. -->

## Motivation

<!-- Context one needs to know to understand this doc: motivating examples, previous versions and problems, links to related projects/design docs, etc. You should mention related work outside of NEAR if applicable. Note: this is background; do not write about your design or ideas to solve problems here. What's the "historical" context? Why do we need a new project? Identify the problems and the needs. -->

## Use Cases

<!-- Who is using this and what does it do? Leave "how" to the design/tech specification sections. If the solution doesn't help these people achieve their goal then the project isn't successful, even if it fills all of the specified technical requirements. -->

### Actors and Actions

<!-- List the different groups of people that will use this widget and what each one can specifically do. If more clarity is needed you can include an actor/action matrix. List all users and their types. List the actions each collective will take individually. User profile description. Describe which action is done by which actors. Feel free to use a table format or provide your own graphics or bundle the description in the Actions section. A "swimlane process chart" often works well here. -->

### User Stories

### Additional Features & Requirements

<!-- Optionally, describe: Expected functionality, Security issues/requirements, Assumptions/dependencies (internal and external), Potential problems/roadblocks, Budget concerns. -->

## Tech Spec

<!-- How does the product implement the features and requirements? Not every feature or requirement needs deep consideration here, but implementation considerations are discusssed they should be captured here. -->

### Smart Contract Functions

<!-- What functions and functionalities should the widget have -->

### Data Structures

### UML Diagrams

<!-- Include diagrams that best capture what needs to be built. Sequence, State, Interaction, Activity, Etc.-->

## Design Specification

<!-- UX and UI that affords all of the features and requirements. How it behaves and what it looks like. -->

### Wireframes / Screens

### UI Design

### Dependent Widgets

<!-- Does the widget interact with other widgets? -->

### Backwards Compatibility

<!-- All proposals that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The doc must explain how to deal with these incompatibilities or the set of requirements to for the backward compatibility to be discussed in a submission. Submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright. -->

## Consequences

<!-- This section describes the consequences, after applying the decision. All consequences should be summarized here, not just the "positive" ones. -->

### Positive

### Negative

### Neutral

## Work Plan

<!-- This can be refined by a party replying to a RFP -->

### Phases

<!-- High-level summary of each phase (if the project does have multiple phases.)  -->

### Sprints

<!-- Break work down into week long chunks. If a team hasn't been identified then assume it will be an individual completing the work. Each sprint should include something which can be considered "Done" so that the product is usable as soon as possible and then recieves incremental improvements. -->

### Audit

<!-- Identify if this widget needs an audit. Does it store sensitive information, transfer tokens, or have a middleware layer? Consult the Security Workgroup if needed. -->

## Open Questions and Comments

<!-- Topics not covered in this document that need to be addressed in a meeting or async. Potential future improvements, Summary of open discussion. -->

## Glossary & References

<!-- Are there any relevant PR comments, issues that led up to this, or articles referenced for why we made the given design choice? Acryonyms or other terminology that could be misunderstood? -->
